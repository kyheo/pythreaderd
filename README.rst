PyThreaderd
===========

Description
+++++++++++
Set of Python utility classes that handle threads and asynchronous activity
listener (‘file’ objects).

This project uses eventloop by `Leandro Lucarella`_ from Pymin_ project

I started with this when I was testing **python** threads. Finally I was able to
use this library on an *Imaging processing* (Aka Imager) application with
different kind of threads all of them manageable by the user by using netcat.

Sadly the *Imaging Processing*, know as **Imager**, is a piece of software
developed in the company where I work, OLX_, perhaps you can try to contact them
to see if they are willing to give up the source code.

Usage
+++++
Import this library in your code and follow *theaderd*,
*threader/threaderdaemon.py* and *threader/tprocessor.py* examples.

Requirements
++++++++++++
This application requires python installed on the system.
